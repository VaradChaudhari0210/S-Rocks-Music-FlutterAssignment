This document outlines the folder structure and development approach for the S-Rocks Music Services Flutter application.

## Core Approach

The application follows a feature-driven approach with a clear separation of concerns, utilizing:

*   **Riverpod:** For robust state management and dependency injection. This allows for decoupled components and easier testing.
*   **Repository Pattern:** To abstract data sources (like Firebase Firestore). This means UI components are not directly tied to data fetching logic, promoting cleaner architecture and easier changes to data sources in the future.
*   **Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) like Structure (Implicitly with Riverpod):**
    *   **Models:** Define the data structures (e.g., `ServiceModel`).
    *   **Views (Screens/Widgets):** Responsible for displaying the UI and reacting to user input. They consume state from Riverpod providers.
    *   **ViewModels (Riverpod Providers/Notifiers):** Manage the state and business logic for the views. They interact with repositories to fetch or manipulate data.

**Key Directory Explanations:**

  *   `lib/`: The heart of the Flutter application.
    *   `models/`: Contains simple Dart classes that define the structure of the data your app works with \
    *   `providers/`: Holds all Riverpod providers. These are responsible for providing dependencies (like a `FirebaseFirestore` instance or a `ServicesRepository`) and managing the application's state.
    *   `views/`: Contains the widgets that represent full screens in your application. These widgets use `ConsumerWidget` or `ConsumerStatefulWidget` from Riverpod to watch providers and rebuild when state changes.
    *   `widgets/`: Contains smaller, reusable UI components that are used within screens or other widgets. For example, `ServiceCard` is a widget that knows how to display a single service.
  *   `assets/`: Contains all the images, icons and fonts used in this application.
This structure aims for maintainability, testability, and scalability by clearly separating UI, business logic, data handling, and state management.
